Code and datasets for WWW 2020 submission titled "Higher-Order Label Homogeneity and Spreading in Graphs"

---------------------------------------
STEPS TO RUN THE CODE FROM COMMAND LINE:
---------------------------------------
0. In Makefile, set PYTHON and MATLAB to appropriate paths.
1. make compile
2. make run DATASET=<DATASET_NAME>
where <DATASET_NAME> = email | polblogs | citation | friendship
for EuEmail, PolBlogs, Cora and Pokec respectively.
(e.g., make run DATASET=polblogs)

------------------
WHAT THE CODE DOES:
------------------
1. Enumerates all k-cliques for k=2,3,4,5 using code accompanying the following paper: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3178876.3186125. (Output: data/*/kcliques.txt)
2. Computes random and observed distribution over label configurations of k-cliques for k=2,3,4,5 by iterating over the enumerated cliques; plots Figure 2 in the paper.
3. Constructs k-clique participation matrices --> this step is currently not optimized and hence takes more time than it should. (Output: data/*/kclique_matrices.txt)
4. Does a grid search for ideal alpha values (how to weight k-cliques for each k). Runs Higher-Order Label Spreading algorithm about 220x5 times. Takes a while. (Output: results/*_grid_search.csv)
5. Plots Figure 3 in the paper (per dataset).

OUTPUT:
------
- Results are stored in results/holh and results/hols.
- Output files are ordered by figure number in the paper, followed by dataset name.
